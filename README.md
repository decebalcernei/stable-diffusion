# Stable Diffusion Pytorch Implementation
Pytorch implementation of a Stable Diffusion model based on the DPMM paper. The project, inspired by Umar Jamil's youtube video, allows to strengthen the knowledge of Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and Diffusion Models.
Pre-trained model weights from Hugging Face were used to try the inference of the model.
